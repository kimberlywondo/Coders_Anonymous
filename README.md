# CODERS ANONYMOUS 1.0 - Project 2
## Overview

For project #2, I created a basic message board app.

Users must sign up to join Coders Anonymous. Once logged in with a valid username, users will be directed to the user home page. From here, two new links will become available and they can either go to their personal page or to the Anonymous confession board. On their personal page, they will find a list of the confessions they've posted to the community board. Here, they can create new confessions to share anonymously, view details from, or delete their own past confessions. 
In the confession Board page, users can view anonymous posts from other users. 
In the future, the buttons on the confession board posts will allow other users to:
- like a post ("you're not alone" button)
- leave a comment which (can be viewed by all users)
- offer one-on-one help to the user that posted the comment (only visible to the user that created the post)
